# Global_wheat_detection


## Overview
This project focuses on detecting wheat heads in images using machine learning techniques. It is based on the **Global Wheat Detection** dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to develop an accurate model that can identify wheat heads in various field conditions.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle's Global Wheat Detection competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection). It consists of:
- **Train images**: High-resolution images of wheat fields with labeled bounding boxes.
- **Train.csv**: A file containing bounding box coordinates for each image.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Downloading dataset using Kaggle API.
   - Extracting and organizing image and annotation files.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding the dataset structure.
   - Visualizing sample images and annotations.
   
3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning the dataset.
   - Normalizing and resizing images.
   - Converting annotations to required format.

4. **Model Development**
   - Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection.
   - Fine-tuning pre-trained models (e.g., Faster R-CNN, YOLO, or EfficientDet).
   - Training the model with optimized hyperparameters.

5. **Evaluation and Testing**
   - Assessing model performance using metrics like **mAP (mean Average Precision)**.
   - Running inference on test images.
   
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `torch`, `torchvision`, `opencv`, `albumentations`

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/global-wheat-detection.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.
4. Run the notebook step by step to preprocess data and train the model.

## Results
- The final model detects wheat heads with high accuracy.
- Sample results and performance metrics are documented in the notebook.

## Future Work
- Improve accuracy using data augmentation and model tuning.
- Experiment with other object detection architectures.
- Deploy the model for real-time inference.
